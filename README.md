#(1) Write a function that stores the first 1000 numbers of the Fibonacci sequence in a numpy array.
#Then write two assertions as tests of your function.
def fibonacci_of(n)
        if n in {0, 1}:
              return n
        return fibonacci_of(n - 1) + fibonacci_of(n - 2)  # Recursive case


[fibonacci_of(n) for n in range(20)]

#(2) Plot the data that is imported below, labeling the X and Y axes.

boston = datasets.load_boston()
y = boston.target
x = boston.data[:, 0]
plt.ylabel = "Home Prices"
plt.xlabel = "Crime"
plt.plot(x, y)
plt.title('Home Prices Vs. Crime')
plt.show()


#(3) Write a function that satisfies the assertions below.
#The function can just multiply each of the number pairs together for the assertions to hold true.
def func(a, b):
    return a*b

assert(func(0, 20) == 0)
assert(func(1, 10) == 10)
assert(func(2, 5) == 10)
assert(func(3, 2) == 6)
assert(func(4, 1) == 4)

#(4) Briefly describe one skill and/or ability you would like to take away from this class.
#I would like to become more proficient in Python.

#(5) Describe your previous experience with programming, statistics, and modeling, including courses and which languages you've used. There is no wrong answer hereâ€”this will help us better tailor the class.
#I took a MatLab course last summer. I also have some experience with Python since I had to learn some of it for a research internship at UCI this past summer.
